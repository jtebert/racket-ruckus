=============

Some of the chaos I have created in Racket.  Because apparently I have nothing better to do with my time.

Currently includes:
- Client & server attendance system (in Class languages)
- Model of genetics (DNA molecules with ligation, annealing, and restriction enzymes; in Class languages) [in progress]

What I want to do:
- Modeling enzyme kinetics
- Implement matrices (Matlab-style), with matrix(row,column) accessors
- Program full space invaders
